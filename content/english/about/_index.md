## ABOUT OUR JOURNEY

Sunrise Semester Foundation started as a passion project led by Michael Lynn. During the pandemic, it became apparent that many individuals did not have the knowledge, capability, and equipment to get to recovery meetings online. Michael assembled a team of passionate recovery-minded individuals who selflessly dedicated their time, money and expertise to build this foundation.
